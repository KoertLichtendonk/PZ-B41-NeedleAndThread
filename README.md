# PZ-B41-NeedleAndThread
Mostly meant to be an extension to the 'Repair Any Mods' mod part of 'Repair Any Clothes'. While playing on a private server, I still came across a lot of items that aren't repairable. This mod aims to change that.

# The following mods and items are supported:

## AuthenticZ
- Michael Myers Mask

## Brita's Armor Pack
- Chainmail Coat
- DUTY Tactical Arm Pad
- EOD 9A Heavy Protection Helmet Face Shield

## Undead Survivor
- Headhunter Gasmask

Let me know if you want me to add any items, whether from vanilla or from other mods!
